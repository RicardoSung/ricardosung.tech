      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone may complain that it&amp;rsquo;s too early for me to write a post about this topic, because I haven&amp;rsquo;t even publish any essay in integrated circuit area. I know maybe there are some issues in the post, but I really need to do it after being asked by my friend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;literature-management&#34;&gt;Literature Management&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first literature management software, which UESTC taught me, was EndNotes. Now, though I won&amp;rsquo;t use EndNotes anymore, it&amp;rsquo;s really a nice software except its price. I prefer to use &lt;strong&gt;Zotero&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides 300M free space to sync. But for me, the free storage is much smaller than that I need.  For a Microsoft365 user, I have a 1T Personal OneDrive Cloud. So I get to think whether there are some motheds to use WebDav of OneDrive, though which is blocked for Personal User. The best way, I think, is to mount OneDrive on Koofr. Plz follow the next steps, and then you can sync your papers on any devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
